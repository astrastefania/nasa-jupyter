# Data science projects on NASA dataset in Jupyter notebooks

In this repository you can find a collection of Jupyter notebooks of data science projects using NASA dataset.
I'll list in here each notebook with a short description.

## Coming soon

I hope to create a Jupyter notebook about Jupiter. ;)
